title: Sprint Dev Week
---

Hello guys!

We had a very cool and exausted week. 

This week we completed a Sprint Dev Session, where we put together the Game Designer, Tech Lead, Art Designer and Sound Designer during one week to push the project. We are very close to release an Alpha Version with new graphics and a fun part of the gameplay implemented for the community. At this moment we are working in an ANDROID version. In the future we are going to work in IOS, WEB and PC. 
Please be connected with our <a href="https://twitter.com/studiosuzumaki">Twitter</a> and return to this page in the future for updates from the game and playable versions.

For now enjoy our new Spank my Bunny Banner.
